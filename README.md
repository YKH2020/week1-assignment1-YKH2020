# Week 1 assignment 

_Python Bootcamp for Data week 1 assignment_

This week, you learned about variables, logic, and Pythonâ€™s data structures to load, persist, and iterate over data. You'll use that knowledge to complete the assignment in this repository.

> ðŸ’¡ This template repository is made for GitHub Classroom delivery, but can be used independently if you want to learn on your own.

## Assignment instructions

This repository uses automated grading (or testing). When starting, all automated tests will fail. Your task is to make them all pass.

1. Open [main.py](./main.py) and address each of the problems defined in the comment blocks
1. Make your changes and push them the repository. 
1. Watch the tests results in the [actions](/../../actions) tab of your repository. Every push will trigger the autograding.
1. Repeat the fix/push/verify cycle until all tests are passing and the [actions](/../../actions) tab shows a green.

> ðŸ’¡ As part of the GitHub Classroom setup, you might get an automated Pull Request created for direct feedback by your Professor or by the TAs.

## Bonus challenge
Open the [bonus](./bonus) directory and then look into the [main.py](./bonus/main.py) file. It has instructions as comments that will guide you on this optional challenge. For this challenge you will use dictionaries to print out file and file sizes of a directory. Follow the instructions for each comment. This bonus assignment is not graded and will not trigger auto-grading. It is meant to be a challenge for you to practice what you learned in the course.
